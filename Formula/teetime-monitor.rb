  depends_on "python@3.12"

  # Deliberately not Language::Python::Virtualenv's own pip_install_and_link -- that
  # helper always passes pip `--no-deps`, expecting every dependency (textual,
  # anthropic, pydantic, beautifulsoup4, and their own transitive deps) as
  # a separately vendored `resource` block, which is the right call for
  # homebrew-core's own reproducibility bar but a lot of upkeep for a personal tap.
  # A plain venv + full `pip install .` instead, pulling straight from PyPI at
  # install time -- the same tradeoff most non-homebrew-core taps make for a real
  # Python application (as opposed to a small pure-Python CLI with few dependencies).

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Like `terraform`/`docker-compose`, this reads its own state (saved clubs,
      credentials, scrape history) from whatever directory you run it in, not a
      fixed install location -- pick one directory and always run it from there,
      e.g.:
        mkdir -p ~/teetime-monitor && cd ~/teetime-monitor
        teetime-monitor   # shows login setup first if nothing's configured yet

      See the README for the full setup walkthrough:
